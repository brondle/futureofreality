# The Future of Reality
by Antonio Guimaraes, Marcela Mancino, Brent Bailey, and Dylan Dawkins
## Backstory
Welcome to the future of reality! This is an interactive performance piece made with [Twine](twinery.org) for the Applications course at [NYU’s Interactive Telecommunications Program](itp.nyu.edu). The piece was made as a response to a talk about the future of reality (specifically in regards to the use of AR and VR) by [Ken Perlin](https://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/) of the NYU Future Reality Lab.
## How To
Ideally, this should be done as a performance with two performers: using the [index] twine, one reading the bold parts and one reading the plaintext parts. There may also be a host to introduce the game, keep order, and count votes - the host’s script can be found in Introduction.rtf. It is designed to be done in front of an audience of numbered rows, who can vote on the story options. A third person should be displaying the [display] twine on a screen or projector and selecting the choices based on the audience’s vote. Each scenario should be read, the audience given time to consider their choice, and then the choices are voted on by the audience. Rows are eliminated by number.

If you don’t have two performers and an audience, however, the game can be played in the browser using the [index] file.

Enjoy!
